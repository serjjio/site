<h1>Follow Development</h1><br>
<p>Zend Framework 2 is under active development. If you are interested in following the development of ZF2, there is a special ZF2 portal on the official Zend Framework website which provides links to the ZF2 wiki, dev blog, issue tracker, and much more. This is a great resource for staying up to date with the latest developments!</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Discover Modules</h2><br>
<p>The community is working on developing a community site to serve as a repository and gallery for ZF2 modules. The project is available on GitHub. The site is currently live and currently contains a list of some of the modules already available for ZF2.</p>
